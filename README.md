# Calculatoorr

This was a small class project, where we were supposed to make a calculator, Not every function works, only basic math, and sin() work, but before each calculation make sure to press (AC) - ALL CLEAR.


## Getting Started
* Download files and unzip them

## Running program

double click on the html file, and the program should load up in the browser. I advise to use chrome or firefox browser
